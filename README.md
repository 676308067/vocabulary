# Vocabulary

CC Vocabulary is a collection of UI components, available both as CSS stylesheets and minified JS, as well as Vue components, that make it easy to develop Creative Commons apps and services while ensuring a cohesive experience and appearance across CC projects.

CC Vocabulary would make it easy for designers to design and prototype mockups, developers to develop evolving standards-compliant code that covers a large number of use-cases out-of-the-box and users to navigate a more consistently familiar CC web presence.

## Goals

CC Vocabulary is a collection of UI components that
- unify all CC services into a cohesive experience and appearance
- cover as many use-cases and scenarios as possible out-of-the-box
- are flexible to accommodate a certain degree of variation
- ensure accessibility, internationalisation and localisation to a large extent
- enable a clear separation between generic components and very app specific components
- come packaged as a simple to use npm package for ease of use
- make it easier for developers to make a seamless experience across the Creative Commons suite

As a library, CC Vocabulary
- provides Storybooks to make it easy to visualise and test-drive components
- will also decrease the barrier of entry and increase the productivity in frontend-development
- will take the effort out of developing the frontend of a new service by enabling remixing components

## Disclaimer

This project is still under development and as a consequence of the fact, users of the library should be expect to encounter bugs. Feedback and bug reports are welcome, fixes and patches even more so.
