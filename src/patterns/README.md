# Patterns

![representation](../assets/icons/pattern.svg)

Patterns are UI patterns that fall on the more complex side of the spectrum. 
Patterns utilize both elements and tokens.

## Working with patterns

Patterns are nothing but Vue components and consequently live in eponymous 
folders containing `Pattern.vue`, `Pattern.md` and `Pattern.styl` files.

Patterns import elements and may import other patterns, although ideologically, 
dependence on other patterns would be minimal.
