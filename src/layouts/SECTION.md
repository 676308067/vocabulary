## Layouts define positions of components.

Layouts place content with respect to other content in the same component. This
is different from templates which place entire components next to each other. 
Thus, they occupy a level between elements and patterns.

_For example_, imagine a three-column grid and how it shrinks to single-column
on mobile screens.
