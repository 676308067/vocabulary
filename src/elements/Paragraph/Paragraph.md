## Paragraphs are just text.

In a paragraph, you write your heart out. You go into details, describe the 
matter and get the entire bulk of the message across.

### Examples

Standard paragraphs generate output which is the same as that generated by 
ordinary `p` tags.

```jsx { "props": { "className": "no-i18n" } }
<Paragraph>Hello World!</Paragraph>
```

But sometimes, you just need to write paragraphs on dark or non-white 
backgrounds, and that a regular `p` tag cannot do. Well, not this easily.

```jsx { "props" : { "className" : "dark-background no-i18n" } }
<Paragraph inverted>Hello World!</Paragraph>
```
