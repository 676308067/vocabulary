## Examples

Standard paragraphs generate output which is the same as that generated by 
ordinary `p` tags.

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  These are some paragraphs for your reading pleasure. As the wise Cicero once 
  said:
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  "Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium
  doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa, quae ab illo inventore
  veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt, explicabo. Nemo enim 
  ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
  consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque
  porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
  adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora 
  inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim
  ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit 
  laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum 
  iure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae 
  consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla 
  pariatur?"
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a 
  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of 
  the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the 
  truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or 
  avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
  know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are 
  extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires 
  to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances 
  occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a 
  trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
  except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault 
  with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
  or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
</Paragraph>
```

### Density set

The line height of text in the paragraph is customisable and can be increased or
decreased as per the needs of the situation.

```jsx
<Paragraph density="dense">
  "Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium
  doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa, quae ab illo inventore
  veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt, explicabo. Nemo enim 
  ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
  consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque
  porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur 
  adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora 
  inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim
  ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit 
  laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum 
  iure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae 
  consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla 
  pariatur?"
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph density="sparse">

```

### Color set

Paragraphs can be colored for some reason.

```jsx
<Paragraph color="blue">
  This is a paragraph colored blue.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="green">
  This is a paragraph colored green.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="magenta">
  This is a paragraph colored magenta.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="olive">
  This is a paragraph colored olive.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="orange">
  This is a paragraph colored orange.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="purple">
  This is a paragraph colored purple.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="red">
  This is a paragraph colored red.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="sand">
  This is a paragraph colored sand.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="yellow">
  This is a paragraph colored yellow.
</Paragraph>
```

And to add to that, you may add one of three shades to them.

```jsx
<Paragraph color="blue" shade="light">
  This is a paragraph colored the light shade of blue.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="blue">
  This is a paragraph colored blue.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="blue" shade="dark">
  This is a paragraph colored the dark shade of blue.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph color="blue" shade="darker">
  This is a paragraph colored the darker shade of blue.
</Paragraph>
```

If your text appears on a dark or otherwise non-white background, use the 
inverted version of the component.

```jsx { "props" : { "className" : "dark-background" } }
<Paragraph is-inverted>
  This paragraph is inverted because it is on a dark background.
</Paragraph>
```
