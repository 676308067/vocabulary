Vocabulary is completely based on 'Source Sans Pro' by Adobe as the body font, 
with fallback on 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica' and finally, if all else 
fails, the generic `sans-serif` font family.

### Sizes

Vocabulary provides a number of font sizes calculated using a harmonic scale 
that scales `4em` over 6 harmonics.

```jsx { "props": { "className": "no-i18n" } }
<Fonts property="size"/>
```

### Weights

In each of these sizes, Vocabulary uses provides three distinct font weights, 
namely light, normal and bold.

```jsx { "props": { "className": "no-i18n" } }
<Fonts property="weight"/>
```
