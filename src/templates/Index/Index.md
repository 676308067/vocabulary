## Index is the homepage of CC Vocabulary.

When people visit the CC Vocabulary homepage, which is different from the CC 
Vocabulary documentation, they will see this page.

### Examples

In normal circumstances, the page looks like this.

```jsx
<Index/>
```

For the lucky 1% of visits, however, the page takes a green hue and shows a
different, strangely reassuring and comforting message, a not-so-subtle
reference to ['The Good Place'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place)
by Michael Schur.

```jsx
<Index forceEasterEggMode/>
<!-- Do not pass this prop in production -->
```
